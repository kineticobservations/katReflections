? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a project with multiple members, especially if you are all working
in different locations. 
Also if you tend to work from multiple computers.
Another reason is if you want to share your work publically.
Also just as a backup periodically if your computer dies, or something else major happens.


? Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

During collaboration, someone might push changes that break your code, so being able to manually say where you are at any time in relation to where
everything else is is important.


? Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches can exist locally or remotely. They let you develop your code base concurrently. That is have multiple
versions of your code existing at the same time.
Clones are a copy of a repository. You can clone something locally or from a remote.
Forks are special clones of repositorys from one GitHub to another GitHub, they have some special feature, like
point back to the original.
