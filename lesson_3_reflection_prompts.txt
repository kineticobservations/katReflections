? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a project with multiple members, especially if you are all working
in different locations. 
Also if you tend to work from multiple computers.
Another reason is if you want to share your work publically.
Also just as a backup periodically if your computer dies, or something else major happens.
